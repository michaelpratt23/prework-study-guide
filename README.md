# Coding Bootcamp Prework Read Me

## Description

As a student enrolled in a coding bootcamp, I created this Prework Study Guide to better understand fundamental web development concepts before the classes start. This guide serves as a practical tool to get hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Motivation: My motivation was to gain a solid grasp of essential web development skills and feel prepared for the upcoming bootcamp.

Purpose: I built this project to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring I can confidently tackle more complex topics during the bootcamp.

Learning Outcomes: Throughout this project, I learned the basics of HTML structure, CSS styling, Git version control, and JavaScript programming, and how these technologies interact to create dynamic web pages.
